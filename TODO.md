# TODO

- when rebase fails we should show the output of the command that failed (eg git push output)
- it would be nice to stream outputs from cli as they come in so we can see real time progress of things like push

- remove no verify from cherry pick it doesn’t work
- instead do ...

```bash
git show sha | git apply
git add .
git commit —no-verify -m “message”
```

- detect rebase and offer a y/n prompt to abort rebase before proceeding






- multiselect with more items than terminal rows needs pagination
  - maybe default to window size of about 10 and display a scrollbar to indicate more items in either direction?
  - allow typing to filder the list based on regex match?
  - quicksearch may be similar or at least inspo

- interactive PR status table
  - ▶ Unassigned (8 commits)
  - ▶ #764 Title B (2/3 commits)  https://github.com/...
  - ▶ #742 Title A (5/5 commits)  https://github.com/...

  - `folder: { on: '▼', off: '▶' },`
  - the first local row shows new commits not synced to any PR
  - (2/3 commits) means 3 commits locally and 2 commits in remote (mismatch)
  - focus + enter toggles the list open to view each commit
  - when expanded
    - each commit should also show status, e.g. new commits should show with NEW
    - show actions, e.g. Shift+D -> Delete
